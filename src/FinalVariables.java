//a variable declared final implies that its value is constant
//for primitives ~ value is constant
//for reference variables ~ reference is constant
//final variables do not get default values

//Final Instance Variable
//constant for the life of the object
//must be initialized in:
//1.declaration statement
//2.constructor
//3.Instance Initializer

//Local Instance Variable
//constant for the rest of the block

//Static Instance Variable
//constant for all instances of the class

//constant variables are final variables whose values are known at compile time
//all constant variables are final variables but not all final variables are constant variables
//for a final variable to be a constant variable:
//1.It must be a primitive or a String
//2.It must be initialized in declaration statement with a constant expression
