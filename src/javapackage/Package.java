//to create our own package in java
//1. set up a directory structure
//2. use package keyword followed by the directory structure


//here javapackage is the directory structure but for example is javapackage was inside another package com
//the directory structure would be like com.javapackage

package javapackage;

public class Package {

    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Inside package");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println();
    }
}
